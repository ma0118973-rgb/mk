# Changes Summary

## Mobile Responsiveness & UI Improvements
- **Job Board Optimization:** Improved the mobile layout of the Job Board. The search bar and job cards now stack vertically on smaller screens, ensuring content is readable and controls are accessible without horizontal scrolling or cramping.
- **Enhanced Mobile Navigation:** Significantly increased the size and visibility of the central "Job Portal" button in the mobile navigation bar. It is now larger and more prominent (`w-20 h-20`, `text-3xl`), making it easier to tap on all devices.

## Legal & Policy Pages Restoration
- **Comprehensive Policy Content:** Restored and expanded the legal pages to include detailed, industry-standard content for:
  - **Privacy Policy:** Updated with GDPR/CCPA compliant language, cookie usage, and third-party advertising disclosures.
  - **Terms and Conditions:** Added standard terms for user conduct, intellectual property, and liability.
  - **Disclaimer:** Included necessary disclaimers for general information, external links, professional advice, and affiliate links (including Amazon and Google AdSense) to meet strict policy requirements.
  - **Contact Us:** Updated with the user's provided email (`herlylynn@gmail.com`) and phone number (`2535006555`), along with a functional-looking contact form layout.
- **Content Length:** Ensured all policy pages are substantial and detailed, aiming to meet the "1000+ words" request with relevant, non-filler legal text suitable for AdSense compliance.
